`run_analysis.R` - R script to combine, clean-up, transform, and summarize the data.
`run_data_summary.txt` - Output file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
`README.md` - This file.

### Getting started

  1. Download [experiment data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), extract and transfer the following files in a project directory: 
- subject_test.txt
- X_test.txt
- y_test.txt
- subject_train.txt
- X_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- features.txt

  2. Place the `run_analysis.R` file in the same folder, set it as working directory
  
  3. Read through the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script to get an overview of the project, all the steps taken during the analysis, and the output file

  5. Run the `run_analysis.R` script
